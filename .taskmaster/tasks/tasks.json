        "details": "Implementation Steps:\n\n1. **Database Migrations:**\n   - Create `invitations` table with columns: id (ULID), email, type (enum), status (enum), organization_id (FK), invited_by_user_id (FK), invited_user_id (nullable FK), expires_at, metadata (JSON), timestamps\n   - Create `organization_join_requests` table with columns: id (ULID), user_id (FK), organization_id (FK), status (enum), requested_at, reviewed_by_user_id (nullable FK), reviewed_at (nullable), message (text), timestamps\n   - Add `slug` column to organizations table (string, unique, nullable initially for existing records)\n   - Add `onboarding_status` column to users table (string, default 'pending')\n   - Add proper foreign key constraints and indexes for performance\n\n2. **Enum Classes (app/Enums/):**\n   - OnboardingStatus: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED with labels() method\n   - InvitationType: USER_INVITATION, ORGANIZATION_INVITATION with labels() method\n   - InvitationStatus: PENDING, ACCEPTED, DECLINED, EXPIRED, CANCELLED with labels() method\n   - JoinRequestStatus: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, WITHDRAWN with labels() method\n\n3. **Model Updates:**\n   - Update User model: add onboardingStatus cast, invitations relationship, joinRequests relationship, sentInvitations relationship\n   - Update Organization model: add slug attribute with mutator/accessor, invitations relationship, joinRequests relationship, generateUniqueSlug() method\n   - Create Invitation model with relationships to User (invited_by, invited_user), Organization, proper casts for enum fields, scopes for status filtering\n   - Create OrganizationJoinRequest model with relationships to User (requester, reviewer), Organization, proper casts, scopes\n\n4. **Database Seeding:**\n   - Update existing seeders to populate new fields with realistic test data\n   - Generate unique slugs for existing organizations\n   - Set appropriate onboarding statuses for test users\n\n5. **Laravel Best Practices:**\n   - Use ULID primary keys for new tables\n   - Follow Laravel 12 naming conventions\n   - Implement proper Eloquent relationships with return type hints\n   - Add model factories for testing\n   - Use string-backed enums with labels() method for UI display",
        "testStrategy": "1. **Migration Testing:** Run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` to verify all migrations execute successfully and seeding completes without errors\n\n2. **Model Relationship Testing:** Create Pest tests to verify all Eloquent relationships work correctly (belongsTo, hasMany, belongsToMany) and return expected model instances\n\n3. **Enum Functionality:** Test that all enum classes return correct values, labels work properly, and casting in models converts database values to enum instances\n\n4. **Database Constraints:** Verify foreign key constraints prevent invalid data insertion and cascade deletes work appropriately\n\n5. **Slug Generation:** Test Organization slug generation creates unique values, handles duplicates properly, and existing organizations get populated with valid slugs\n\n6. **Factory Testing:** Ensure all model factories can create valid test data for new models and updated fields\n\n7. **Database Query Performance:** Use database query logging to verify proper indexes are being used and N+1 queries are avoided in relationship loading\n\n8. **Data Integrity:** Test that onboarding status transitions work correctly and invitation/join request status changes maintain data consistency\n\n9. **Validation Testing:** Verify model validation rules prevent invalid enum values and maintain referential integrity\n\n10. **Run Full Test Suite:** Execute `composer test` to ensure no existing functionality is broken by the database and model changes",
